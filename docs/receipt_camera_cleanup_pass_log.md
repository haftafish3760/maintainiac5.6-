# Receipt Camera Cleanup Pass Log

This log tracks each cleanup/QA pass during the receipt camera, OCR, and shared
receipt pipeline repair work. Times are local to the development machine.

Scope:
- Added a low-light damaged OCR fixture so the synthetic pack covers true
  too-dark receipt capture alongside blur, glare, crop, and low contrast.
- Pinned the damaged OCR pack count/name regression so focused QA fails if the

Verification:
- Passed targeted Dart format/analyzer and focused Flutter OCR source
