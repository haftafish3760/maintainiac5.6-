# Receipt Camera Cleanup Pass Log Archive - Pass 527

Archived from `docs/receipt_camera_cleanup_pass_log.md` to keep the active log
within the project line-count cap while preserving the pass history.

## Pass 527 - 01:56:00 EDT to 02:00:00 EDT

Scope:
- Hardened OCR parser line-id metadata maps so duplicate stable line IDs also
  preserve the first role, parser bucket, expense family, parser hint, and
  customer-proof visibility.
- Extended duplicate-ID regression coverage across adjacent parser handoff and
  customer-proof maps.
- Recorded `BUG-RECEIPT-0045` under `receipt_line_numbering`.

Verification:
- Passed targeted Dart format and analyzer for parser handoff line maps,
  customer-proof maps, and parser handoff structure regression coverage.
- Passed focused Flutter test
  `test/receipt_ocr_service_parser_handoff_structure_test.dart --plain-name
  "parser handoff line id maps preserve first duplicate line id"`.
- Passed bug-ledger gate, cleanup-log gate, doc-size gate, source audit, and
  diff check.
