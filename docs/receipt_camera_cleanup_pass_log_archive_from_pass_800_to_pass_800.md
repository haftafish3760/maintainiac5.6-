# Receipt Camera Cleanup Pass Log Archive: Pass 800

Archived from `docs/receipt_camera_cleanup_pass_log.md` to keep the active log
under the project document-size cap.

## Pass 800 - 09:07:30 EDT to active cleanup

Scope:
- Renamed unreadable OCR source-prep cleanup actions that implied the original
  image was used after a missing file or decode failure.
- Kept stable failure decision codes while changing cleanup action labels to
  no-clear-OCR-source wording.
- Added unreadable-source regressions rejecting the old `_original_used`
  action family.
- Recorded `BUG-RECEIPT-0284` under `source_preservation`.
- Archived Pass 768 from the active cleanup log to keep the doc under cap.

Verification:
- Passed targeted Dart format/analyzer and focused OCR source-guard
  regression.
- Passed cleanup log, doc-size, bug-ledger, source-audit, test-audit, and diff
  whitespace gates.
