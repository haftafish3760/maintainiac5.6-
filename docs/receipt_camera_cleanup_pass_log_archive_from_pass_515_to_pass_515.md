# Receipt Camera Cleanup Pass Log Archive - Pass 515

Archived from the live cleanup log to keep
`docs/receipt_camera_cleanup_pass_log.md` under the project line-count cap.

## Pass 515 - 01:13:06 EDT to 01:14:21 EDT

Scope:
- Hardened in-entry receipt draft line redaction anchors so unsaved/manual line
  IDs that include typed descriptions use deterministic private-safe tokens.
- Hardened draft OCR line labels so unsafe source IDs fall back to a generic
  receipt-line label.
- Added source regression coverage proving the old raw draft-line ID fallback is
  gone from the assisted review entry model.
- Recorded `BUG-RECEIPT-0033` under `privacy_redaction`.
- Archived Pass 478 out of the live cleanup log to keep the active log under
  the project line-count cap.

Verification:
- Fixed an initial focused-test failure caused by asserting helper placement in
  the wrong source bundle, then tightened draft OCR line labels and reran.
- Passed targeted Dart format and analyzer for draft line models, computed
  fields, support helpers, and assisted-review regression coverage.
- Passed focused Flutter test
  `test/expense_receipt_assisted_review_flow_test.dart --plain-name "assisted
  receipt review exposes classification and attachment flow"`.
- Passed `dart tool/receipt_bug_regression_ledger_gate.dart`.
