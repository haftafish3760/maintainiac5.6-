# Receipt Camera Cleanup Pass Log Archive - Pass 798

Archived from `docs/receipt_camera_cleanup_pass_log.md` to keep the active log
under the 500-line cap.

## Pass 798 - 09:00:00 EDT to active cleanup

Scope:
- Renamed stale OCR source policy guard tokens away from
  original-quality wording to temporary full-quality source wording.
- Kept explicit original-quality proof wording only for user-selected
  original proof retention.
- Updated shared flow and attachment risk flags to use the new temporary source
  guard token.
- Added scanner-prep regression assertions that reject the old internal guard
  wording.
- Recorded `BUG-RECEIPT-0282` under `source_preservation`.

Verification:
- Passed targeted Dart format/analyzer and focused stitch-scanner regression.
- Passed cleanup log, doc-size, bug-ledger, source-audit, test-audit, and diff
  whitespace gates.
