# Receipt Camera Cleanup Pass Log Archive - Pass 804

Archived from the active receipt camera cleanup log to keep the current log
under the project line cap.

## Pass 804 - 09:39:00 EDT to active cleanup

Scope:
- Fixed manual Add Photo continuation so a valid previous receipt section can
  activate the ghost overlay even when no OCR-specific reason code exists yet.
- Added the safe default `manual_add_photo_continuation` reason while keeping
  no-photo/no-reason continuation inactive.
- Updated continuation guide regressions for manual Add Photo ghost behavior.
- Recorded `BUG-RECEIPT-0288` under `ghost_overlap_stitching`.
- Archived Pass 772 from the active cleanup log to keep the doc under cap.

Verification:
- Passed targeted Dart format/analyzer and focused capture-flow shareability
  regression.
- Passed cleanup log, doc-size, bug-ledger, source-audit, test-audit, and diff
  whitespace gates.
