# Receipt Camera Cleanup Pass Log Archive - Pass 807

Archived from the active receipt camera cleanup log to keep the current log
under the project line cap.

## Pass 807 - 10:24:00 EDT to active cleanup

Scope:
- Hardened barcode/QR batch scanning so duplicate receipt image paths are
  skipped before decoder/ML Kit work.
- Added a privacy-safe duplicate-image batch warning bucket.
- Added a regression proving duplicate long-receipt image paths do not trigger
  duplicate barcode scans.
- Recorded `BUG-RECEIPT-0291` under `barcode_qr_scanning`.
- Archived Pass 775 from the active cleanup log to keep the doc under cap.

Verification:
- Passed targeted Dart format/analyzer and focused barcode scanner regression.
- Passed cleanup log, doc-size, bug-ledger, source-audit, test-audit, and diff
  whitespace gates.
